summary   = An animated face that speaks whatever you type
description = Speak is a talking face for the XO laptop. Anything you type will
            be spoken aloud using the XO's speech synthesizer, espeak. You can
            adjust the accent, rate and pitch of the voice as well as the shape
            of the eyes and mouth.
            This is a great way to experiment with the speech synthesizer,
            learn to type or just have fun making a funny face for your XO.

long_description: Sugar Learning Platform - speak activity
 Sugar Learning Platform promotes collaborative learning through Sugar
 Activities that encourage critical thinking, the heart of a quality
 education.  Designed from the ground up especially for children, Sugar
 offers an alternative to traditional “office-desktop” software.
 .
 Learner applications in Sugar are called Activities.  They are software
 packages that automatically save your work - producing specific
 instances of the Activity that can be resumed at a later time.  Many
 Activities support learner collaboration, where multiple learners may
 be invited to join a collective Activity session.
 .
 Speak is a talking face for Sugar. Anything you type will be spoken aloud using
 the speech syntesizer, espeak. You can adjust the accent, rate and pith of the voice
 and the face displayed.
